ABC Tech management is looking for ways to improve the incident management process as recent customer survey results shows that incident management is rated as poor. Machine Learning as way to improve ITSM processes ABC Tech management recently attended Machine Learning conference on ML for ITSM. Machine learning looks prospective to improve ITSM processes through prediction and automation. They came up with 4 key areas, where ML can help ITSM process in ABC Tech.

1.Predicting High Priority Tickets: To predict priority 1 & 2 tickets, so that they can take preventive measures or fix the problem before it surfaces.

2.Forecast the incident volume in different fields , quarterly and annual. So that they can be better prepared with resources and technology planning.

3.Auto tag the tickets with right priorities and right departments so that reassigning and related delay can be reduced.

4.Predict RFC (Request for change) and possible failure / misconfiguration of ITSM assets.
